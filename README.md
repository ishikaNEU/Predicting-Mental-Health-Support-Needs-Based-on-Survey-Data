# Mental Health Support Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict whether an individual may need mental health support based on features such as age, gender, work interference, and whether the individual receives benefits. The model is built using RandomForestClassifier.

## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the dataset.
- `src/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing and pipeline.
- `app/`: A simple Streamlit app for predicting mental health support needs based on user input.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model building.

## Usage
To run the Streamlit app locally:
1. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the app:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app/app.py
   ```
